   Great lab!

   Code structure and implementation:

   Nicely structured and well commented code!

   Compilation:

   The code compiled with no errors or warnings.

   Performance and testing:

   The program ran correctly in my tests except for:

   -1 The program accepted a screen size of 0 as a command line argument, but then
   did not display a list of Horn clauses even after valid ones were processed.

   -3 The set and randomize commands did not operate correctly when dealing with
   variables that were not already in the symbol table - instead of having the
   desired effect they set the variables to 0 which required re-issuing the same 
   commands a second time:

input commands: set z 10
new BOUND variable added! With value attribute 0
input commands: randomize b
b value changed to 7238
input commands: randomize a 50
a value changed to 15
input commands: randomize x
new BOUND variable added! With value attribute 7306
input commands: randomize y 40
new BOUND variable added! With value attribute 31
input commands: print
Symbol Table:
father 1 2
father 2 3
mother 3 4
mother 4 5
a 15
b 7238
father a b
c 9
mother b c
parent X Y
father X Y
mother X Y
ancestor X Y
parent X Z
ancestor Z Y
q 0
ok B q 7
z 0
x 0
y 0
input commands: set z 10
value changed!
input commands: randomize y
y value changed to 7444
input commands: randomize x 20
x value changed to 5
input commands: print
Symbol Table:
father 1 2
father 2 3
mother 3 4
mother 4 5
a 15
b 7238
father a b
c 9
mother b c
parent X Y
father X Y
mother X Y
ancestor X Y
parent X Z
ancestor Z Y
q 0
ok B q 7
z 10
x 5
y 7444

   Project report and documentation:

   Testing description is too brief, especially for a final project, but otherwise ok.

   Extra credit: +5

   Nice job!
