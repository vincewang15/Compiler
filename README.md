1.Coded parsers to scan input by recursive decent parsing pattern.
2.Identified specific kinds of token by creating a user-Ë‡defined scanner and recognized Horn clauses from
input grammar.
3.Wrote an AST parser with decent parsing parsers to construct Abstract Syntax Tree of the Horn clauses
recognized. A Symbol Table was created to store different elements of AST nodes.
4.Implemented unification algorithm to do matching operations based on the idea from logic programming.
